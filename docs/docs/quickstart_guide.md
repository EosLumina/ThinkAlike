# ThinkAlike Quickstart Guide

This guide provides the fastest way to get a local development environment set up for the ThinkAlike project.

**Prerequisites:**

*   You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher) and npm installed on your system (for frontend development). We recommend using the LTS (Long-Term Support) version.
*   You'll need [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system (for backend development).
*   You'll need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
*   You'll need Git installed on your system. ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads))

**1. Clone the Repository:**

Open your terminal (or command prompt) and run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Willeede/thinkalike_project.git
cd thinkalike_project
```

**2. Install Dependencies:**

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Backend:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

**3. Run the Project (Development Mode):**

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

This will start the frontend development server. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

Backend:

```bash
cd backend/app
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

This will start the backend development server. You can access the API documentation (provided by FastAPI) by going to [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).

**4. Making a Change and Contributing:**

To contribute to ThinkAlike, please follow these guidelines:

Create a new branch: Use the following command to create a new branch, based on the type of task, and also including the issue number.

* Bug fixes: 
```bash
git checkout -b fix/#[issue number]-[short-description-of-fix] 
# Example: git checkout -b fix/#123-navigation-link
```

* New features:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/#[issue-number]-[short-feature-description]
# Example: git checkout -b feature/#45-add-login-form
```

* UI Testing:
```bash
git checkout -b ui-test/#[issue-number]-[short-test-description]
# Example: git checkout -b ui-test/#67-data-table-accessibility
```

* Code Style Changes:
```bash
git checkout -b style/#[issue-number]-[short-description-of-changes]
```

* Documentation:
```bash
git checkout -b docs/#[issue-number]-[short-description-of-changes]
```

Make your changes, always following the project guidelines (UI, Code, Data, AI) that you can find in the project documentation.

Test your workflows using UI testing components.

If needed, make changes in the UI testing parameters or components, and generate a new test cycle.

Commit your changes: Use clear and descriptive commit messages.

Push your branch:
```bash
git push origin [your-branch-name]
```

Create a pull request: Go to the ThinkAlike repository on GitHub and create a pull request from your branch to the main branch. Provide a clear description of your changes and the results of your testing.

**5. Finding Your First Task:**

Check the Issues tab on our GitHub repository for a list of open tasks.
Start with tasks labeled "good first issue" or "help wanted".

**6. Code Style Guide:**

All implementations must follow a reusable approach, with clear and understandable code implementation and UI design patterns.
Make sure that your code is well documented and also, that it follows our UI testing framework.

**7. Testing Guide:**

Create a new branch for every test.
Implement the tests using the UI workflow parameters, and use that data to generate the documentation about what is being tested and what are the results.
All testing should also be validated by user data (where applicable).

**Next Steps:**

Explore the codebase: Familiarize yourself with the project structure and the existing code.
Read the full documentation: Refer to the `docs/` folder for more in-depth information.
Ask questions! If you're unsure about anything, don't hesitate to ask for help.
