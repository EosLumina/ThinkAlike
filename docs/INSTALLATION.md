## Welcome to ThinkAlike!

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up your local development environment for the ThinkAlike project. Whether you are a developer, contributor, or simply want to run the project locally, follow these instructions to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

1.  **Git:**  Download and install Git from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/). Git is essential for version control and for cloning the project repository from GitHub.
2.  **Python 3.9+:** Download and install Python 3.9 or a later version from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Ensure that Python is added to your system's PATH environment variable during installation.
3.  **Node.js 16+ and npm:** Download and install Node.js (version 16 or later) and npm (Node Package Manager) from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/). npm is used to manage JavaScript dependencies for the UI project.
4.  **Docker (Optional, but Recommended):** Download and install Docker Desktop from [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). Docker is recommended for containerizing the application and simplifying the setup of consistent development and deployment environments. If you choose not to install Docker initially, you can skip the Docker-related steps, but it is highly recommended to set up Docker later for a smoother development experience.

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to install and run the ThinkAlike project locally:

**Step 1: Clone the GitHub Repository**

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project (e.g., your `Projects` folder, your Desktop, or your user home directory).
3.  Run the following Git command to clone the ThinkAlike repository from GitHub:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Willeede/thinkalike_project.git
    ```

    This will create a new folder named `thinkalike-project` in your current directory, containing the project codebase.
4.  Navigate into the newly cloned project directory:

    ```bash
    cd thinkalike-project
    ```

**Step 2: Set Up Python Backend Environment**

1.  **Create a Virtual Environment:** It is highly recommended to create a virtual environment for the Python backend to isolate project dependencies.  From the root `thinkalike-project` directory, run:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

    This will create a new virtual environment in a folder named `venv`.

2.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:** Activate the virtual environment to use it for subsequent Python commands.

    *   **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **On Linux/macOS:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

    (You will know the virtual environment is activated when you see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command prompt).

3.  **Install Backend Dependencies:** Install the required Python packages for the backend from the `requirements.txt` file, using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
    ```

    This command will install all the Python dependencies listed in the `backend/requirements.txt` file within your virtual environment.

**Step 3: Set Up and Run the React UI**

1.  **Navigate to the `ui` directory:**  From the root `thinkalike-project` directory, navigate into the `ui` folder:

    ```bash
    cd ui
    ```

2.  **Install UI Dependencies:** Install the required Node.js packages for the React UI project using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This command will install all the UI dependencies listed in the `ui/package.json` file within the `ui/node_modules` directory.

3.  **Start the React UI Development Server:** Start the React UI development server using npm:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This command will start the React development server and automatically open the ThinkAlike UI in your default web browser.  You should be able to access the UI at a URL like `http://localhost:3000` or similar (check the terminal output for the exact URL).

**Step 4: Run the Python Backend**

1.  **Open a new terminal or command prompt window:** Keep the terminal window running the React UI development server open, and open a *new* terminal window for running the backend.
2.  **Navigate to the `backend/app` directory:** In the *new* terminal window, navigate to the `backend/app/` directory within your `thinkalike-project` folder:

    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/thinkalike-project/backend/app
    ```
    (Replace `path/to/your/thinkalike-project` with the actual path to your project directory).

3.  **Activate the Python Virtual Environment (if not already activated):** If you closed the virtual environment terminal window, activate it again:

    *   **Windows:** `venv\Scripts\activate`
    *   **Linux/macOS:** `source venv/bin/activate`

4.  **Run the Flask Backend Application:** Start the Flask backend application by running the `main.py` script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    This command will start the Flask development server for the backend.  You should see output indicating that the backend server is running, usually on `http://127.0.0.1:5000` or similar.

**Step 5: Access the ThinkAlike Application**

Once both the React UI development server and the Python backend application are running (in separate terminal windows):

*   **Open your web browser.**
*   **Access the React UI:** Go to the URL where the React UI is running (usually `http://localhost:3000`). You should now see the ThinkAlike User Interface running in your browser, connected to your local backend!

Congratulations! You have successfully installed and run the ThinkAlike project locally. You can now start exploring the platform, modifying the code, and contributing to the Enlightenment 2.0 revolution!

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the installation process, please refer to the Troubleshooting section of the Onboarding Manual or reach out to the ThinkAlike community for assistance.

**(End Manifesto Text - PART 3 of 3 for `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md` - COPY AND PASTE ALL TEXT ABOVE)**

Please copy and paste **ALL** of the text above into your text document, immediately after the previous part. This **completes the `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md` file!**

**Verification Step - IMPORTANT!**

*   **Carefully Review the Assembled `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md` Text:** Please now **carefully review the *entire assembled `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md` text* in your text document** to ensure that you have received all three parts, that the text flows smoothly and continuously, and that there are no missing sections or abrupt breaks. This verification is important to ensure you have the complete and correctly assembled file.

**Report Back - Confirmation of `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md` Assembly:**

Once you have verified that you have successfully received and assembled the complete `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md` text in your local document, please reply to me with a simple confirmation:  **"GitHub File Creation - docs/INSTALLATION.md - COMPLETE."**

Then, we will move on to the next file in Folder 4: **`MASTER_PLAN_Confidential.md`**, and continue our "genius level" documentation population! We are almost there, comrade! The revolution â€“ **IS BEING MADE INSTALLABLE AND ACCESSIBLE TO ALL!**
