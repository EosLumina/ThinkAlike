## Getting Started

Before you start contributing, please follow these steps:

1.  **Read the [Onboarding Guide](#) and [Quickstart Guide](#).** These documents provide an overview of the project, its goals, and how to set up your development environment.
2.  **Explore the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Willeede/thinkalike_project).** Familiarize yourself with the project structure, codebase, and existing documentation.
3.  **Check the [Issues Tab](https://github.com/Willeede/thinkalike_project/issues).** Look for open issues labeled "good first issue" or "help wanted." These are good starting points for new contributors.
4.  **Join our community:** Introduce yourself on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/TnAcWezH), and let us know what areas you are interested in.

## Contribution Workflow

ThinkAlike follows a standard Git-based workflow:

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create your own fork of the ThinkAlike repository on GitHub. This gives you a personal copy of the codebase to work on.
2.  **Clone Your Fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/thinkalike_project.git  # Replace with YOUR fork's URL
    cd thinkalike_project
    ```

3.  **Create a Feature Branch:** For *each* contribution (bug fix, new feature, documentation update, etc.), create a *new* branch from the `main` branch. Use a descriptive branch name that reflects the purpose of your contribution.  Use the following prefixes:

    *   `fix/`: For bug fixes.
    *   `feature/`: For new features.
    *   `docs/`: For documentation updates.
    *   `ui-test/`: For UI testing related changes.
    *   `style/`: For code style changes.

    Use this format: `[branch-type]/#[issue-number]-[short-description]`

    Examples:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b fix/#123-navigation-link
    git checkout -b feature/#45-add-login-form
    git checkout -b docs/#99-update-readme
    ```

4.  **Make Your Changes:** Implement your contribution, following the coding style guidelines (see below) and best practices. Write clear, concise, and well-documented code.

5.  **Test Thoroughly:** *Before* submitting your changes, test them *thoroughly*. This includes:
    *   **Unit Tests:** If you're adding or modifying code, write unit tests to verify its functionality.
    *   **Integration Tests:** If your changes affect multiple components, test the interactions between them.
    *   **UI Tests:** Use the UI testing framework to validate the appearance and behavior of UI components.
    *   **Manual Testing:** Manually test your changes in a browser to ensure they work as expected.
    *   **Use UI testing parameters:** Use UI data feedback components to test and document your changes.

6.  **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes with clear and descriptive commit messages. Follow the Conventional Commits specification (see below).

7.  **Push to Your Fork:** Push your branch to your *forked* repository on GitHub:

    ```bash
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```

8.  **Create a Pull Request (PR):**
    *   Go to the main ThinkAlike repository on GitHub.
    *   You should see a prompt to create a pull request from your recently pushed branch.
    *   Click "Compare & pull request."
    *   Provide a *clear and detailed description* of your changes. Explain the *purpose* of the contribution, the *problem* it solves, and *how* you tested it. Reference any relevant issues (e.g., "Fixes #123").
    *   If your change affects the UI, include screenshots or GIFs demonstrating the changes.
    *   Select appropriate reviewers (if you know who to ask; otherwise, leave it blank).

9.  **Code Review and Collaboration:** Project maintainers and community members will review your PR. They may provide feedback, request changes, or ask questions. Be responsive and collaborative during the review process. Address any feedback and make the necessary revisions.

10. **Merge:** Once your PR is approved, a project maintainer will merge it into the `main` branch. Congratulations! Your contribution is now part of ThinkAlike.

## Code Style Guidelines

*(This section will link to a separate `code_style.md` file. For now, I'm providing some general guidelines.)*

We strive for clean, readable, and maintainable code. Please follow these guidelines:

*   **Frontend (React):**
    *   Follow the [Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide](https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/).
    *   Use functional components and Hooks whenever possible.
    *   Write clear and concise component names.
    *   Use meaningful variable and function names.
    *   Keep components small and focused. Break down large components into smaller, reusable ones.
    *   Use CSS Modules or Styled Components for component-specific styles.
    *   Thoroughly test all components, using the UI as a testing tool.
    *   For more details, check the [`code_style.md`](../code_style.md) file.

*   **Backend (Python/FastAPI):**
    *   Follow the [PEP 8 Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
    *   Use type hints.
    *   Write clear and concise function names.
    *   Use meaningful variable names.
    *   Keep functions short and focused.
    *   Include docstrings for all functions and classes.
    *   Thoroughly test all code.
    *   For more details, check the [`code_style.md`](../code_style.md) file.

*   **General:**
    *   Write clear and concise comments to explain *why* your code does what it does (not just *what* it does).
    *   Use consistent indentation (4 spaces for Python, 2 spaces for JavaScript/React).
    *   Avoid unnecessary code duplication. Use functions and components to promote reusability.
    *   Keep code as simple as possible (but no simpler).
    *   Prioritize readability.

## Documentation Guidelines

*   **Markdown:** Use Markdown for all documentation files.
*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** Write clear, concise, and easy-to-understand documentation.
*   **Accuracy:** Ensure that all documentation is accurate and up-to-date.
*   **Completeness:** Provide comprehensive documentation for all aspects of the project.
*   **Structure:** Use headings, lists, and other formatting elements to organize the documentation logically.
*   **Examples:** Include code examples and usage instructions where appropriate.
*   **UI Driven:** Use UI components to provide feedback about data workflows.

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for commit messages. This helps us automate the changelog generation and provides a consistent history.

**Commit Message Structure:**

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

*   **`<type>`:** Must be one of the following:
    *   `feat`: A new feature.
    *   `fix`: A bug fix.
    *   `docs`: Documentation only changes.
    *   `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.).
    *   `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
    *   `perf`: A code change that improves performance.
    *   `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
    *   `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files (e.g., updating build scripts).
    *   `ui-test`: Changes related to UI testing parameters or workflows.
*   **`[optional scope]`:** A scope may be provided to a commit’s type to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., `feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays`. In our project, you can use scopes like `ui`, `backend`, `ai`, `docs`, `tests`.
*   **`<description>`:** A short description of the change in the present imperative tense (e.g., "Add login form," *not* "Added login form" or "Adds login form").

**Example Commit Messages:**

```
feat(ui): add data traceability component
fix(backend): resolve database connection issue
docs: update onboarding guide with contribution guidelines
test(ui): add unit tests for action button component
style(frontend): format code with Prettier
chore: update dependencies
ui-test(DataTraceability): implement tests for data loading
```

## Using AI Coding Assistants

We encourage using AI coding assistants like Copilot or Gemini to improve your coding experience. However, always *review*, *understand*, and *test* the code suggested by these tools. AI-generated code is not always perfect and may require modifications. **You are responsible for the quality and correctness of the code you submit, regardless of whether it was written by you or by an AI assistant.**

Here are a few example prompts you can use with AI coding assistants:

*   **To understand a component:**

    > "Explain the purpose and functionality of the following React component, including the meaning of each prop and the expected data types:
    >  ```jsx
    >  [Paste component code here]
    >  ```"

*   **To write a test:**

    > "Write a unit test for the following Python function using pytest:
    >  ```python
    >  [Paste function code here]
    >  ```"

*   **To refactor code:**

    > "Refactor the following JavaScript code to improve readability and maintainability. Explain the changes you made:
    >  ```javascript
    >  [Paste code snippet here]
    >  ```"

*   **To write documentation:**

    > "Write a concise documentation comment (in JSDoc format) for the following React component:
    >  ```jsx
    >  [Paste component code here]
    >  ```"

*   **Debugging:**

    > "Explain this error: [Error message]. Here's the code: [Paste code]"

* **To write a commit message:**

    > "Write a conventional commit message for this change: [Describe the change you made]"

By providing *specific* code snippets and clear instructions, you can get much more useful results from AI assistants. Remember to always review and adapt the suggestions to fit the project's specific needs.
