## Getting Started

Before you start contributing, please follow these steps:

1.  **Read the [Onboarding Guide](docs/onboarding/ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md) and [Quickstart Guide](docs/onboarding/quickstart.md).** These documents provide an overview of the project, its goals, and how to set up your development environment.
2.  **Explore the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Willeede/thinkalike_project).** Familiarize yourself with the project structure, codebase, and existing documentation.
3.  **Check the [Issues Tab](https://github.com/Willeede/thinkalike_project/issues).** Look for open issues labeled "good first issue" or "help wanted." These are good starting points for new contributors.
4. **Join our community** Introduce yourself, and let us know what areas are you interested in.

## Contribution Workflow

ThinkAlike follows a standard Git-based workflow:

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create your own fork of the ThinkAlike repository on GitHub. This gives you a personal copy of the codebase to work on.
2.  **Clone Your Fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <your_fork_url>
    cd thinkalike_project
    ```

3.  **Create a Feature Branch:** For *each* contribution (bug fix, new feature, documentation update, etc.), create a *new* branch from the `main` branch. Use a descriptive branch name that reflects the purpose of your contribution.  Use the following prefixes:

    *   `fix/`: For bug fixes.
    *   `feature/`: For new features.
    *   `docs/`: For documentation updates.
    *   `ui-test/`: For UI testing related changes.
    *   `style/`: For code style changes.

    Use this format: `[branch-type]/#[issue-number]-[short-description]`

    Examples:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b fix/#123-navigation-link
    git checkout -b feature/#45-add-login-form
    git checkout -b docs/#99-update-readme
    ```

4.  **Make Your Changes:** Implement your contribution, following the coding style guidelines (see below) and best practices.  Write clear, concise, and well-documented code.

5.  **Test Thoroughly:**  *Before* submitting your changes, test them *thoroughly*.  This includes:
    *   **Unit Tests:** If you're adding or modifying code, write unit tests to verify its functionality.
    *   **Integration Tests:** If your changes affect multiple components, test the interactions between them.
    *   **UI Tests:** Use the UI testing framework to validate the appearance and behavior of UI components.
    *   **Manual Testing:**  Manually test your changes in a browser to ensure they work as expected.
    * **Use UI testing parameters** Use UI data feedback components to test and document your changes.

6.  **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes with clear and descriptive commit messages. Follow the Conventional Commits specification (see below).

7.  **Push to Your Fork:** Push your branch to your *forked* repository on GitHub:

    ```bash
    git push origin <your-branch-name>
    ```

8.  **Create a Pull Request (PR):**
    *   Go to the main ThinkAlike repository on GitHub.
    *   You should see a prompt to create a pull request from your recently pushed branch.
    *   Click "Compare & pull request."
    *   Provide a *clear and detailed description* of your changes.  Explain the purpose of the contribution, the problem it solves, and how you tested it.  Reference any relevant issues (e.g., "Fixes #123").
    *   If your change affects the UI, include screenshots or GIFs demonstrating the changes.
    *   Select appropriate reviewers (if you know who to ask; otherwise, leave it blank).

9.  **Code Review and Collaboration:** Project maintainers and community members will review your PR.  They may provide feedback, request changes, or ask questions.  Be responsive and collaborative during the review process.  Address any feedback and make the necessary revisions.

10. **Merge:** Once your PR is approved, a project maintainer will merge it into the `main` branch.  Congratulations! Your contribution is now part of ThinkAlike.
